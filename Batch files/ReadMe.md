#Run as administrator
In most cases you want to be able to just double click on a batch file to run it, especially if it is a quick output utility with no required input.

To do this do the following:
1. Make a short cut to the target batch file
2. Right click on the short cut and select "Properties"
3. Click on the "Advanced..." button
4. Tick the "Run as administrator" box

That's it - next time just double click on the short cut and your batch file should prompt you if you want to run this item as administrator. Select "Yes" like you would normally.
