# Use the JSON version

- RedGate stopped using the `XML` format they were supporting for so many years in favor of JSON. I think the change happened around March 2021, not sure.
- If you need to convert your snippets then follow [these instructions](https://forum.red-gate.com/discussion/87969/convert-old-style-sql-prompt-snippets-the-xml-version-to-the-new-json-format).
- The snippets in this folder are no longer supported, please use the `JSON` version that is in the JSON folder.
